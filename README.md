# Exploration of MIND dataset 
In this project, I use the public [MIND](https://msnews.github.io/) dataset to predict news category. This dataset was made available in 2020, and is composed of English news articles for news recommendation research. In this project I do not explore the recommender potentials of the dataset, but rather the nature of news categories (as labeled in the news.tsv dataset). As analysis was run locally, for time considerations I use the small MIND data. 

Towards this project, I also employed pretrained sentence BERT embeddings, as made publicly available by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych in 2020.
